============================

Gradle Kotlin DSL v0.12.2 is another minor update to the [v0.12.0][v0.12.0] release, this time with a fix for a defect identified during the Gradle RC2 testing phase.

v0.12.2 is already included in Gradle 4.3 RC3.

To use it, upgrade your Gradle wrapper in the following fashion:

    $ cd $YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT
    $ gradle wrapper --gradle-version 4.3-rc-3 --distribution-type all

## Breaking changes

Please check out the [v0.12.0][v0.12.0] release notes for details.

Fixes since v0.12.1
----------------------

 * **Auto-applied build scan plugin not found when used in Kotlin DSL** ([#3250](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/3250)). Executing Gradle with the `--scan` command line option in a project where the main build script contains a `buildscript` block that applies other scripts would cause the build to fail as described in the issue. This has been fixed.
